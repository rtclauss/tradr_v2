# tradr

This is a new Node.js-hosted and Vue.js-based user interface for StockTrader.  It calls the default `portfolio` 
JAX-RS web services when interacting with stock portfolios. As such `portfolio` must be exposed via ingress for `tradr`
 to work properly.
 
*Note:* There is a bug where the UI does not function if the portfolio database is empty.  
 
 ### Prerequisites
 Along with the `jwt` and `oidc` secrets required for the `trader` service to work `tradr` requires a secret defining
  the ingress host and port where `tradr` will run.  You create this secret by running:
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic ingress-host --from-literal=host=<PROXY_HOSTNAME>:<PROXY_SSL_PORT>
  
  # Example:
  kubectl create secret generic ingress-host --from-literal=host=myicpproxy.ibm.com:443
  
  # Or
  kubectl create secret generic ingress-host --from-literal=host=myicpproxy.ibm.com:443 -n stock-trader
  ```
  
  You'll also need to enable login to the IBM Cloud Private internal Docker registry by following [these steps]
  (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0/manage_images/configuring_docker_cli.html).  Don't 
  forget to restart Docker after adding your cert.  On macOS you can restart Docker by running:
  ```bash
  osascript -e 'quit app "Docker"'
  open -a Docker
  ```
 
 ### Build and Deploy 
To build `tradr` clone this repo and run:
```bash
docker build -t tradr:latest -t <ICP_CLUSTER>.icp:8500/stock-trader/tradr:latest .
docker tag tradr:latest <ICP_CLUSTER>.icp:8500/stock-trader/tradr:latest
docker push <ICP_CLUSTER>.icp:8500/stock-trader/tradr:latest

kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

In practice this means you'll run something like:
```bash
docker build -t tradr:latest -t mycluster.icp:8500/stock-trader/tradr:latest .
docker tag tradr:latest mycluster.icp:8500/stock-trader/tradr:latest
docker push mycluster.icp:8500/stock-trader/tradr:latest

kubectl --namespace stock-trader apply -f manifests/
```

Once the `tradr` containers start you can reach the new UI by navigating to 
[https://<PROXY_HOSTNAME>:<PROXY_SSL_PORT>/tradr](https://<PROXY_HOSTNAME>:<PROXY_SSL_PORT>/tradr).  Using the 
previous example that is: [https://myicpproxy.ibm.com/tradr](https://myicpproxy.ibm.com/tradr) (since https is port 
443 you can drop the ssl port from the URL in this example).
